# Third-party notices

Traza is Apache-2.0 (see [LICENSE](LICENSE) and [NOTICE](NOTICE)). The
distributed artifacts — release archives and container images — additionally
contain the third-party material below. The generated Rust inventory includes
build tools and proc macros conservatively; their presence in the inventory
does not mean they are linked into the distributed binaries.

## In the Rust binaries

The default standalone build uses `serde`, `serde_json`, `lz4_flex`, and their
transitive dependencies. Release archives and images also include the optional
`object-storage` feature and `traza-object` CLI, adding `object_store`, Tokio,
the HTTP/TLS stack, and their dependencies.

The exact versions, upstream license expressions, copyright notices, and
license texts for the locked release graph are preserved in
[THIRD_PARTY_RUST_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_RUST_NOTICES.md). The accompanying
[inventory](THIRD_PARTY_RUST_INVENTORY.json) records each crate archive and
license-file SHA256, its source URL, and the applicable release targets.
This includes the Apache Arrow object-store NOTICE, AWS-LC/BoringSSL terms,
Unicode data notices, and other component-specific terms.

These files are generated from checksum-verified published crate archives by
`python3 scripts/generate-rust-notices.py`; CI rejects drift from `Cargo.lock`.
The Apache-2.0 text for Traza itself is in [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## In the release container's certificate bundle

The container includes Mozilla certificate data from Alpine's
`ca-certificates-bundle`. Its attribution and source location are in
[CERTIFICATE_BUNDLE_NOTICE.md](CERTIFICATE_BUNDLE_NOTICE.md), with the Mozilla
Public License text in [MPL-2.0.txt](MPL-2.0.txt). The archives use the host
platform's certificate trust store.

## In the dashboard build (`ui/dist`)

- **React** and **react-dom** (with its `scheduler` dependency) — MIT
  License, Copyright (c) Meta Platforms, Inc. and affiliates.
- **Inter** — SIL Open Font License 1.1, Copyright 2016 The Inter Project
  Authors (https://github.com/rsms/inter).
- **JetBrains Mono** — SIL Open Font License 1.1, Copyright 2020 The
  JetBrains Mono Project Authors
  (https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono).

Both fonts are vendored as latin-subset variable woff2 and inlined into the
single-file dashboard build.

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.
